# Predicting Walmart Sales - Tyme Series Analysis

### This is one of my personal DS/ML/DL projects I've been working in since I started my career as a Data Scientist.

## Project Overview

Machine Learning Project in Python created to forecast Walmart sales using statistical, ARIMA and Random Forest Regressors.
Project included: 
  - Breakdown Problem Statement
  - EDA & database cleaning
  - Perform Univariate & bi-variate analysis for both numeric and categorical variables
  - Feature engineering and feature selection
  - Prepare the data for modelling
  - Create models using:
    - Random Forest
    - Statistical Model
    - ARIMA (Autoregressive integrated moving average)
  - Perform Hyper-parameter tuning
  - Compare the performance of different models using RMSE.


## Problem Statement

One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. If Christmas comes but once a year, so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line.

In this recruiting competition, job-seekers are provided with historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions. Each store contains many departments, and participants must project the sales for each department in each store. To add to the challenge, selected holiday markdown events are included in the dataset. These markdowns are known to affect sales, but it is challenging to predict which departments are affected and the extent of the impact.

This competition is evaluated on the weighted mean absolute error (WMAE).


## Code and resources used
**Python Version:** 3.7

**Packages:** Pandas / Numpy / Seaborn / Scikitlearn / ARIMA / 

**ML Resources:** Logistic Regression / Gradient Boosting / Cross-validation / AUC / ROC / Confusion Matrix


## Model Building



## Model Performance

I tried three different models and evaluated them using RMSE.
